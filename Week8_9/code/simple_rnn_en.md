#  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Language Modeling

In previous tutorials, we worked with *feedforward* neural networks. They're called feedforward networks because each layer feeds into the next layer in a chain connecting the inputs to the outputs.


![](./multilayer-perceptron.png)

At each iteration $t$, we feed in a new example $x_t$, by setting the values of the input nodes (orange). We then *feed the activation forward* by successively calculating the activations of each higher layer in the network. Finally, we read the outputs from the topmost layer. 

So when we feed the next example $x_{t+1}$, we overwrite all of the previous activations. If consecutive inputs to our network have no special relationship to each other (say, images uploaded by unrelated users), then this is perfectly acceptable behavior. But what if our inputs exhibit a sequential relationship?

Say for example that you want to predict the next character in a string of text. We might decide to feed each character into the neural network with the goal of predicting the succeeding character. 

![](./recurrent-motivation.png)

In the above example, the neural network forgets the previous context every time you feed a new input. How is the neural network supposed to know that "e" is followed by a space? It's hard to see why that should be so probable if you didn't know that the "e" was the final letter in the word "Time". 

Recurrent neural networks provide a slick way to incorporate sequential structure. At each time step $t$, each hidden layer $h_t$ (typically) will receive input from both the current input $x_t$ and from *that same hidden layer* at the previous time step $h_{t-1}$

![](./recurrent-lm.png)

Now, when our net is trying to predict what comes after the "e" in time, it has access to its previous *beliefs*, and by extension, the entire history of inputs. Zooming back in to see how the nodes in a basic RNN are connected, you'll see that each node in the hidden layer is connected to each node at the hidden layer at the next time step:

![](./simple-rnn.png)

Even though the neural network contains loops (the hidden layer is connected to itself), because this connection spans a time step our network is still technically a feedforward network. Thus we can still train by backpropagration just as we normally would with an MLP. Typically the loss function will be an average of the losses at each time step.

In this tutorial, we're going to roll up our sleeves and write a simple RNN in MXNet using nothing but ``mxnet.ndarray`` and ``mxnet.autograd``. In practice, unless you're trying to develop fundamentally new recurrent layers, you'll want to use the prebuilt layers that call down to extremely optimized primitives. You'll also want to rely on some pre-built batching code because batching sequences can be a pain. But we think in general, if you're going to work with this stuff, and have a modicum of self respect, you'll want to implement from scratch and understand how it works at a reasonably low level. 

Let's go ahead and import our dependencies and specify our context. If you've been following along without a GPU until now, this might be where you'll want to get your hands on some faster hardware. GPU instances are available by the hour through Amazon Web Services. A single GPU via a [p2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/) (NVIDIA K80s) or even an older g2 instance will be perfectly adequate for this tutorial.

```{.python .input  n=1}
from __future__ import print_function
import mxnet as mx
from mxnet import nd, autograd
import numpy as np
mx.random.seed(1)
ctx = mx.gpu(1)
```

```{.json .output n=1}
[
 {
  "name": "stderr",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "/home/zli/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/h5py/__init__.py:36: FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `float` to `np.floating` is deprecated. In future, it will be treated as `np.float64 == np.dtype(float).type`.\n  from ._conv import register_converters as _register_converters\n"
 }
]
```

## Dataset: "The Time Machine" 

Now mess with some data. I grabbed a copy of the ``Time Machine``, mostly because it's available freely thanks to the good people at [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) and a lot of people are tired of seeing RNNs generate Shakespeare. In case you prefer torturing Shakespeare to torturing H.G. Wells, I've also included Andrej Karpathy's tinyshakespeare.txt in the data folder. Let's get started by reading in the data.

```{.python .input  n=2}
with open("./timemachine.txt") as f:
    time_machine = f.read()
```

And you'll probably want to get a taste for what the text looks like.

```{.python .input  n=3}
print(time_machine[0:500])
```

```{.json .output n=3}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "Project Gutenberg's The Time Machine, by H. G. (Herbert George) Wells\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

 }
]
```

## Tidying up

I went through and discovered that the last 38083 characters consist entirely of legalese from the Gutenberg gang. So let's chop that off lest our language model learn to generate such boring drivel.

```{.python .input  n=4}
print(time_machine[-38075:-37500])
time_machine = time_machine[:-38083]
```

```{.json .output n=4}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "End of Project Gutenberg's The Time Machine, by H. G. (Herbert George) Wells\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TIME MACHINE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 35.txt or 35.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/3/35/\n\n\n\n        Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\n        will be renamed.\n\n        Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no\n        one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n        (and you!) c\n"
 }
]
```

## Numerical representations of characters

When we create numerical representations of characters, we'll use one-hot representations. A one-hot is a vector that takes value 1 in the index corresponding to a character, and 0 elsewhere. Because this vector is as long as the vocab, let's get a definitive list of characters in this dataset so that our representation is not longer than necessary.

```{.python .input  n=5}
character_list = list(set(time_machine))
vocab_size = len(character_list)
print(character_list)
print("Length of vocab: %s" % vocab_size)
```

```{.json .output n=5}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "['o', 'u', 'r', 'A', '8', 'x', 'X', ';', 'p', '4', 'M', 'H', 'j', ')', 'c', 'w', 'E', '0', 'T', '2', '#', '5', 'z', 'e', ']', 'S', 'J', 'Q', 'R', 'I', '[', '.', '?', 't', 'm', 'd', '9', \"'\", 's', 'h', 'k', 'g', '\\n', 'L', 'O', '3', 'W', ',', 'V', '\"', 'C', 'K', 'n', 'i', 'D', '-', 'G', 'q', '(', 'B', 'a', ':', 'Y', 'y', 'b', 'F', '!', '*', '_', 'N', 'l', 'v', 'U', 'f', '1', ' ', 'P']\nLength of vocab: 77\n"
 }
]
```

We'll often want to access the index corresponding to each character quickly so let's store this as a dictionary.

```{.python .input  n=6}
character_dict = {}
for e, char in enumerate(character_list):
    character_dict[char] = e
print(character_dict)
```

```{.json .output n=6}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "{'o': 0, 'u': 1, 'r': 2, 'A': 3, '8': 4, 'x': 5, 'X': 6, ';': 7, 'p': 8, '4': 9, 'M': 10, 'H': 11, 'j': 12, ')': 13, 'c': 14, 'w': 15, 'E': 16, '0': 17, 'T': 18, '2': 19, '#': 20, '5': 21, 'z': 22, 'e': 23, ']': 24, 'S': 25, 'J': 26, 'Q': 27, 'R': 28, 'I': 29, '[': 30, '.': 31, '?': 32, 't': 33, 'm': 34, 'd': 35, '9': 36, \"'\": 37, 's': 38, 'h': 39, 'k': 40, 'g': 41, '\\n': 42, 'L': 43, 'O': 44, '3': 45, 'W': 46, ',': 47, 'V': 48, '\"': 49, 'C': 50, 'K': 51, 'n': 52, 'i': 53, 'D': 54, '-': 55, 'G': 56, 'q': 57, '(': 58, 'B': 59, 'a': 60, ':': 61, 'Y': 62, 'y': 63, 'b': 64, 'F': 65, '!': 66, '*': 67, '_': 68, 'N': 69, 'l': 70, 'v': 71, 'U': 72, 'f': 73, '1': 74, ' ': 75, 'P': 76}\n"
 }
]
```

```{.python .input  n=8}
time_numerical = [character_dict[char] for char in time_machine]
```

```{.python .input  n=9}
#########################
#  Check that the length is right
#########################
print(len(time_numerical))

#########################
#  Check that the format looks right
#########################
print(time_numerical[:20])

#########################
#  Convert back to text
#########################
print("".join([character_list[idx] for idx in time_numerical[:39]]))
```

```{.json .output n=9}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "179533\n[76, 2, 0, 12, 23, 14, 33, 75, 56, 1, 33, 23, 52, 64, 23, 2, 41, 37, 38, 75]\nProject Gutenberg's The Time Machine, b\n"
 }
]
```

## One-hot representations

We can use NDArray's one_hot() operation to render a one-hot representation of each character. But frack it, since this is the from scratch tutorial, let's write this ourselves.

```{.python .input  n=10}
def one_hots(numerical_list, vocab_size=vocab_size):
    result = nd.zeros((len(numerical_list), vocab_size), ctx=ctx)
    for i, idx in enumerate(numerical_list):
        result[i, idx] = 1.0
    return result
```

```{.python .input  n=11}
print(one_hots(time_numerical[:2]))
```

```{.json .output n=11}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "\n[[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.\n  0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.\n  0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.\n  0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]\n [0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.\n  0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.\n  0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.\n  0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]\n<NDArray 2x77 @gpu(1)>\n"
 }
]
```

That looks about right. Now let's write a function to convert our one-hots back to readable text.

```{.python .input  n=12}
def textify(embedding):
    result = ""
    indices = nd.argmax(embedding, axis=1).asnumpy()
    for idx in indices:
        result += character_list[int(idx)]
    return result
```

```{.python .input  n=13}
textify(one_hots(time_numerical[0:40]))
```

```{.json .output n=13}
[
 {
  "data": {
   "text/plain": "\"Project Gutenberg's The Time Machine, by\""
  },
  "execution_count": 13,
  "metadata": {},
  "output_type": "execute_result"
 }
]
```

## Preparing the data for training

Great, it's not the most efficient implementation, but we know how it works. So we're already doing better than the majority of people with job titles in machine learning. Now, let's chop up our dataset into sequences that we could feed into our model.

You might think we could just feed in the entire dataset as one gigantic input and backpropagate across the entire sequence. When you try to backpropagate across thousands of steps a few things go wrong:
(1) The time it takes to compute a single gradient update will be unreasonably long
(2) The gradient across thousands of recurrent steps has a tendency to either blow up, causing NaN errors due to losing precision, or to vanish.

Thus we're going to look at feeding in our data in reasonably short sequences. Note that this home-brew version is pretty slow; if you're still running on a CPU, this is the right time to make dinner.

```{.python .input  n=14}
seq_length = 64
# -1 here so we have enough characters for labels later
num_samples = (len(time_numerical) - 1) // seq_length
dataset = one_hots(time_numerical[:seq_length*num_samples]).reshape((num_samples, seq_length, vocab_size))
textify(dataset[0])
```

```{.json .output n=14}
[
 {
  "data": {
   "text/plain": "\"Project Gutenberg's The Time Machine, by H. G. (Herbert George) \""
  },
  "execution_count": 14,
  "metadata": {},
  "output_type": "execute_result"
 }
]
```

Now that we've chopped our dataset into sequences of length ``seq_length``, at every time step, our input is a single one-hot vector. This means that our computation of the hidden layer would consist of matrix-vector multiplications, which are not especially efficient on GPU. To take advantage of the available computing resources, we'll want to feed through a batch of sequences at the same time. The following code may look tricky but it's just some plumbing to make the data look like this.

![](img/recurrent-batching.png)

```{.python .input  n=15}
batch_size = 32
```

```{.python .input  n=16}
print('# of sequences in dataset: ', len(dataset))
num_batches = len(dataset) // batch_size
print('# of batches: ', num_batches)
train_data = dataset[:num_batches*batch_size].reshape((batch_size, num_batches, seq_length, vocab_size))
# swap batch_size and seq_length axis to make later access easier
train_data = nd.swapaxes(train_data, 0, 1)
train_data = nd.swapaxes(train_data, 1, 2)
print('Shape of data set: ', train_data.shape)
```

```{.json .output n=16}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "# of sequences in dataset:  2805\n# of batches:  87\nShape of data set:  (87, 64, 32, 77)\n"
 }
]
```

Let's sanity check that everything went the way we hope. For each data_row, the second sequence should follow the first:

```{.python .input  n=17}
for i in range(3):
    print("***Batch %s:***\n %s \n %s \n\n" % (i, textify(train_data[i, :, 0]), textify(train_data[i, :, 1])))
```

```{.json .output n=17}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "***Batch 0:***\n Project Gutenberg's The Time Machine, by H. G. (Herbert George)  \n vement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday nig \n\n\n***Batch 1:***\n Wells\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost a \n ht\nit fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upwar \n\n\n***Batch 2:***\n nd with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, giv \n d to\nhere. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of  \n\n\n"
 }
]
```

## Preparing our labels

Now let's repurpose the same batching code to create our label batches

```{.python .input  n=18}
labels = one_hots(time_numerical[1:seq_length*num_samples+1])
train_label = labels.reshape((batch_size, num_batches, seq_length, vocab_size))
train_label = nd.swapaxes(train_label, 0, 1)
train_label = nd.swapaxes(train_label, 1, 2)
print(train_label.shape)
```

```{.json .output n=18}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "(87, 64, 32, 77)\n"
 }
]
```

## A final sanity check

Remember that our target at every time step is to predict the next character in the sequence. So our labels should look just like our inputs but offset by one character. Let's look at corresponding inputs and outputs to make sure everything lined up as expected.

```{.python .input  n=19}
print(textify(train_data[10, :, 3]))
print(textify(train_label[10, :, 3]))
```

```{.json .output n=19}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "te, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the\nben\ne, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the\nbenc\n"
 }
]
```

## Recurrent neural networks

![](img/simple-rnn.png)

Recall that the update for an ordinary hidden layer in a neural network with activation function $\phi$ is given by 
$$\boldsymbol h = \phi(\boldsymbol x W + \boldsymbol b)$$

To make this a recurrent neural network, we're simply going to add a weight sum of the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$:

$$\boldsymbol h_t = \phi(\boldsymbol x_t  W_{xh} + \boldsymbol h_{t-1} W_{hh} + \boldsymbol b_h )$$

Then at every time set $t$, we'll calculate the output as:
$$\boldsymbol {\hat{y}}_t = \text{softmax}_{one-hot}(\boldsymbol h_t W_{hy} + \boldsymbol b_y)$$

## Allocate parameters

```{.python .input  n=20}
num_inputs = vocab_size
num_hidden = 256
num_outputs = vocab_size

########################
#  Weights connecting the inputs to the hidden layer
########################
Wxh = nd.random_normal(shape=(num_inputs,num_hidden), ctx=ctx) * .01

########################
#  Recurrent weights connecting the hidden layer across time steps
########################
Whh = nd.random_normal(shape=(num_hidden,num_hidden), ctx=ctx) * .01

########################
#  Bias vector for hidden layer
########################
bh = nd.random_normal(shape=num_hidden, ctx=ctx) * .01


########################
# Weights to the output nodes
########################
Why = nd.random_normal(shape=(num_hidden,num_outputs), ctx=ctx) * .01
by = nd.random_normal(shape=num_outputs, ctx=ctx) * .01

# NOTE: to keep notation consistent, 
# we should really use capital letters 
# for hidden layers and outputs, 
# since we are doing batchwise computations] 
```

## Attach the gradients

```{.python .input  n=21}
params = [Wxh, Whh, bh, Why, by]

for param in params:
    param.attach_grad()
```

## Softmax Activation

```{.python .input  n=22}
def softmax(y_linear, temperature=1.0):
    lin = (y_linear-nd.max(y_linear, axis=1).reshape((-1,1))) / temperature # shift each row of y_linear by its max
    exp = nd.exp(lin)
    partition =nd.sum(exp, axis=1).reshape((-1,1))
    return exp / partition
```

```{.python .input  n=23}
####################
# With a temperature of 1 (always 1 during training), we get back some set of probabilities
####################
softmax(nd.array([[1, -1], [-1, 1]]), temperature=1.0)
```

```{.json .output n=23}
[
 {
  "data": {
   "text/plain": "\n[[0.880797   0.11920292]\n [0.11920292 0.880797  ]]\n<NDArray 2x2 @cpu(0)>"
  },
  "execution_count": 23,
  "metadata": {},
  "output_type": "execute_result"
 }
]
```

```{.python .input  n=24}

```

[
 {

   "text/plain": "\n[[0.50049996 0.49949998]\n [0.49949998 0.50049996]]\n<NDArray 2x2 @cpu(0)>"
  },
  "execution_count": 24,
  "metadata": {},
  "output_type": "execute_result"
 }
]
```

```{.python .input  n=25}
####################
# Often we want to sample with low temperatures to produce sharp probabilities
####################
softmax(nd.array([[10,-10],[-10,10]]), temperature=.1)
```

```{.json .output n=25}

 {
  "data": {
   "text/plain": "\n[[1. 0.]\n [0. 1.]]\n<NDArray 2x2 @cpu(0)>"
  },
  "execution_count": 25,
  "metadata": {},
  "output_type": "execute_result"
 }
]
```

## Define the model

```{.python .input  n=26}
def simple_rnn(inputs, state, temperature=1.0):
    outputs = []
    h = state
    for X in inputs:
        h_linear = nd.dot(X, Wxh) + nd.dot(h, Whh) + bh
        h = nd.tanh(h_linear)
        yhat_linear = nd.dot(h, Why) + by
        yhat = softmax(yhat_linear, temperature=temperature) 
        outputs.append(yhat)
    return (outputs, h)
```

## Cross-entropy loss function

At every time step our task is to predict the next character, given the string up to that point. This is the familiar multi-task classification that we introduced for handwritten digit classification. Accordingly, we'll rely on the same loss function, cross-entropy.

```{.python .input  n=27}
# def cross_entropy(yhat, y):
#     return - nd.sum(y * nd.log(yhat))

def cross_entropy(yhat, y):
    return - nd.mean(nd.sum(y * nd.log(yhat), axis=0, exclude=True))
```

```{.python .input  n=28}
cross_entropy(nd.array([[.2,.5,.3], [.2,.5,.3]]), nd.array([[1.,0,0], [0, 1.,0]]))
```

```{.json .output n=28}
[
 {
  "data": {
   "text/plain": "\n[1.1512926]\n<NDArray 1 @cpu(0)>"
  },
  "execution_count": 28,
  "metadata": {},
  "output_type": "execute_result"
 }
]
```

## Averaging the loss over the sequence

Because the unfolded RNN has multiple outputs (one at every time step) we can calculate a loss at every time step. The weights corresponding to the net at time step $t$ influence both the loss at time step $t$ and the loss at time step $t+1$. To combine our losses into a single global loss, we'll take the average of the losses at each time step.

```{.python .input  n=29}
def average_ce_loss(outputs, labels):
    assert(len(outputs) == len(labels))
    total_loss = 0.
    for (output, label) in zip(outputs,labels):
        total_loss = total_loss + cross_entropy(output, label)
    return total_loss / len(outputs)
```

## Optimizer

```{.python .input  n=30}
def SGD(params, lr):    
    for param in params:
        param[:] = param - lr * param.grad
```

## Generating text by sampling

We have now defined a model that takes a sequence of real inputs from our training data and tries to predict the next character at every time step. You might wonder, what can we do with this model? Why should I care about predicting the next character in a sequence of text?

This capability is exciting because given such a model, we can now generate strings of plausible text. The generation procedure goes as follows. Say our string begins with the character "T". We can feed the letter "T" and get a conditional probability distribution over the next character $P(x_2|x_1=\text{"T"})$. We can the sample from this distribution, e.g. producing an "i", and then assign $x_2=\text{"i"}$, feeding this to the network at the next time step.

[Add a nice graphic to illustrate sampling]

```{.python .input  n=31}
def sample(prefix, num_chars, temperature=1.0):
    #####################################
    # Initialize the string that we'll return to the supplied prefix
    #####################################
    string = prefix

    #####################################
    # Prepare the prefix as a sequence of one-hots for ingestion by RNN
    #####################################
    prefix_numerical = [character_dict[char] for char in prefix]

## Conclusions

Once you start running this code, it will spit out a sample at the end of each epoch. I'll leave this output cell blank so you don't see megabytes of text, but here are some patterns that I observed when I ran this code. 

The network seems to first work out patterns with no sequential relationship and then slowly incorporates longer and longer windows of context. After just 1 epoch, my RNN generated this:

>         e       e e ee    e   eee     e     e ee   e  e      ee     e e   ee  e   e            ee    e   e   e     e  e   e     e          e   e ee e    aee    e e               ee  e     e   ee ee   e ee     e e       e e e        ete    e   e e   e e   e       ee  n eee    ee e     eeee  e e    e         e  e  e ee    e  e   e    e       e  e  eee ee      e         e            e       e    e e    ee   ee e e e   e  e  e e  e t       e  ee         e eee  e  e      e ee    e    e       e                e      eee   e  e  e   eeeee      e     eeee e e   ee ee     ee     a    e e eee           ee  e e   e e   aee           e      e     e e               eee       e           e         e     e    e e   e      e   e e   e    e    e ee e      ee                 e  e  e   e    e  e   e                    e      e   e        e     ee  e    e    ee n  e   ee   e  e         e  e         e      e    t    ee  ee  ee   eee  et     e        e     e e              ee   e  e  e     e  e  e e       e              e       e"

It's learned that spaces and "e"s (to my knowledge, there's no aesthetically pleasing way to spell the plural form of the letter "e") are the most common characters.

A little bit later on it spits out strings like:

> the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the

At this point it's learned that after the space usually comes a nonspace character, and perhaps that "t" is the most common character to immediately follow a space, "h" to follow a "t" and "e" to follow "th". However it doesn't appear to be looking far enough back to realize that the word "the" should be very unlikely immediately after the word "the"... 

By the 175th epoch, the model appears to be putting together a fairly large vocabulary although it puts words together in ways that might be charitably described as "creative".

In subsequent tutorials we'll explore sophisticated techniques for evaluating and improving language models. We'll also take a look at some related but more complicate problems like language translations and image captioning.
