## Preparing our labels

```{.python .input  n=7}

## Long short-term memory (LSTM) RNNs

An LSTM block has mechanisms to enable "memorizing" information for an extended number of time steps. We use the LSTM block with the following transformations that map inputs to outputs across blocks at consecutive layers and consecutive time steps: $\newcommand{\xb}{\mathbf{x}} \newcommand{\RR}{\mathbb{R}}$

$$g_t = \text{tanh}(X_t W_{xg} + h_{t-1} W_{hg} + b_g),$$

$$i_t = \sigma(X_t W_{xi} + h_{t-1} W_{hi} + b_i),$$

$$f_t = \sigma(X_t W_{xf} + h_{t-1} W_{hf} + b_f),$$

$$o_t = \sigma(X_t W_{xo} + h_{t-1} W_{ho} + b_o),$$

$$c_t = f_t \odot c_{t-1} + i_t \odot g_t,$$

$$h_t = o_t \odot \text{tanh}(c_t),$$

where $\odot$ is an element-wise multiplication operator, and
for all $\xb = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k]^\top \in \RR^k$ the two activation functions:

$$\sigma(\xb) = \left[\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x_1)}, \ldots, \frac{1}{1+\exp(-x_k)}]\right]^\top,$$

$$\text{tanh}(\xb) = \left[\frac{1-\exp(-2x_1)}{1+\exp(-2x_1)},  \ldots, \frac{1-\exp(-2x_k)}{1+\exp(-2x_k)}\right]^\top.$$

In the transformations above, the memory cell $c_t$ stores the "long-term" memory in the vector form.
In other words, the information accumulatively captured and  encoded  until time step $t$ is stored in $c_t$ and is only passed along the same layer over different time steps.

Given the inputs $c_t$ and $h_t$, the input gate $i_t$ and forget gate $f_t$ will help the memory cell to decide how to overwrite or keep the memory information. The output gate $o_t$ further lets the LSTM block decide how to retrieve the memory information to generate the current state $h_t$ that is passed to both the next layer of the current time step and the next time step of the current layer. Such decisions are made using the hidden-layer parameters $W$ and $b$ with different subscripts: these parameters will be inferred during the training phase by ``gluon``.
