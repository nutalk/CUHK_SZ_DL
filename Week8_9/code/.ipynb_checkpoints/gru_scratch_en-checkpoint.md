#  Gated recurrent unit (GRU) RNNs

This chapter requires some exposition. The GRU updates are fully implemented and the code appears to work properly.

```{.python .input  n=1}
from __future__ import print_function
import mxnet as mx
from mxnet import nd, autograd
import numpy as np
mx.random.seed(1)
ctx = mx.gpu(1)
```

```{.json .output n=1}
[
 {
  "name": "stderr",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "/home/zli/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/h5py/__init__.py:36: FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `float` to `np.floating` is deprecated. In future, it will be treated as `np.float64 == np.dtype(float).type`.\n  from ._conv import register_converters as _register_converters\n"
 }
]
```

## Dataset: "The Time Machine"

```{.python .input  n=2}
with open("./timemachine.txt") as f:
    time_machine = f.read()
time_machine = time_machine[:-38083]
```

## Numerical representations of characters

```{.python .input  n=3}
character_list = list(set(time_machine))
vocab_size = len(character_list)
character_dict = {}
for e, char in enumerate(character_list):
    character_dict[char] = e
time_numerical = [character_dict[char] for char in time_machine]
```

## One-hot representations

```{.python .input  n=4}
def one_hots(numerical_list, vocab_size=vocab_size):
    result = nd.zeros((len(numerical_list), vocab_size), ctx=ctx)
    for i, idx in enumerate(numerical_list):
        result[i, idx] = 1.0
    return result
```

```{.python .input  n=5}
def textify(embedding):
    result = ""
    indices = nd.argmax(embedding, axis=1).asnumpy()
    for idx in indices:
        result += character_list[int(idx)]
    return result
```

## Preparing the data for training

```{.python .input  n=6}
batch_size = 32
seq_length = 64
# -1 here so we have enough characters for labels later
num_samples = (len(time_numerical) - 1) // seq_length
dataset = one_hots(time_numerical[:seq_length*num_samples]).reshape((num_samples, seq_length, vocab_size))
num_batches = len(dataset) // batch_size
train_data = dataset[:num_batches*batch_size].reshape((num_batches, batch_size, seq_length, vocab_size))
# swap batch_size and seq_length axis to make later access easier
train_data = nd.swapaxes(train_data, 1, 2)
```

## Preparing our labels

```{.python .input  n=7}
labels = one_hots(time_numerical[1:seq_length*num_samples+1])
train_label = labels.reshape((num_batches, batch_size, seq_length, vocab_size))
train_label = nd.swapaxes(train_label, 1, 2)
```

## Gated recurrent units (GRU) RNNs

Similar to LSTM blocks, the GRU also has mechanisms to enable "memorizing" information for an extended number of time steps. However, it does so in a more expedient way:

* We no longer keep a separate memory cell $c_t$. Instead, $h_{t-1}$ is added to a "new content" version of itself to give $h_{t}$.
* The "new content" version is given by $g_t = \text{tanh}(X_t W_{xh} + (r_t \odot h_{t-1})W_{hh} + b_h ),$ and is analogous to $g_t$ in the LSTM tutorial.
* Here, there is a reset gate $r_t$ which moderates the impact of $h_{t-1}$ on the "new content" version.
* The input gate $i_t$ and forget gate $f_t$ are replaced by an single update gate $z_t$, which weighs the old and new content via $z_t$ and $(1 - z_t)$ respectively.
* There is no output gate $o_t$; the weighted sum is what becomes $h_t$.

We use the GRU block with the following transformations that map inputs to outputs across blocks at consecutive layers and consecutive time steps: $\newcommand{\xb}{\mathbf{x}} \newcommand{\RR}{\mathbb{R}}$

$$z_t = \sigma(X_t W_{xz} + h_{t-1} W_{hz} + b_z),$$

$$r_t = \sigma(X_t W_{xr} + h_{t-1} W_{hr} + b_r),$$

$$g_t = \text{tanh}(X_t W_{xh} + (r_t \odot h_{t-1})W_{hh} + b_h ),$$

$$h_t = z_t \odot h_{t-1} + (1-z_t) \odot g_t,$$

where $\sigma$ and $\text{tanh}$ are as before in the LSTM case. 

Empirically, GRUs have similar performance to LSTMs, while requiring less parameters and forgoing an internal time state. Intuitively, GRUs have enough gates/state for long-term retention, but not too much, so that training and convergence remain fast and convex. See the work of Chung et al. [2014] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555).

## Allocate parameters

```{.python .input  n=8}
num_inputs = vocab_size
num_hidden = 256
num_outputs = vocab_size

#  Weights connecting the inputs to the hidden layer
########################

Wxr = nd.random_normal(shape=(num_inputs,num_hidden), ctx=ctx) * .01
Wxh = nd.random_normal(shape=(num_inputs,num_hidden), ctx=ctx) * .01

########################
#  Recurrent weights connecting the hidden layer across time steps
########################
Whz = nd.random_normal(shape=(num_hidden,num_hidden), ctx=ctx)* .01
Whr = nd.random_normal(shape=(num_hidden,num_hidden), ctx=ctx)* .01

########################
#  Bias vector for hidden layer
########################
bz = nd.random_normal(shape=num_hidden, ctx=ctx) * .01
br = nd.random_normal(shape=num_hidden, ctx=ctx) * .01
bh = nd.random_normal(shape=num_hidden, ctx=ctx) * .01

########################
# Weights to the output nodes
########################
Why = nd.random_normal(shape=(num_hidden,num_outputs), ctx=ctx) * .01
by = nd.random_normal(shape=num_outputs, ctx=ctx) * .01
```

## Attach the gradients

```{.python .input  n=9}
params = [Wxz, Wxr, Wxh, Whz, Whr, Whh, bz, br, bh, Why, by]

for param in params:
    param.attach_grad()
```

## Softmax Activation

```{.python .input  n=10}
def softmax(y_linear, temperature=1.0):
    lin = (y_linear-nd.max(y_linear)) / temperature
    exp = nd.exp(lin)
    partition = nd.sum(exp, axis=0, exclude=True).reshape((-1,1))
    return exp / partition
```

## Define the model

```{.python .input  n=11}
def gru_rnn(inputs, h, temperature=1.0):
    outputs = []
    for X in inputs:
        z = nd.sigmoid(nd.dot(X, Wxz) + nd.dot(h, Whz) + bz)
        r = nd.sigmoid(nd.dot(X, Wxr) + nd.dot(h, Whr) + br)
        g = nd.tanh(nd.dot(X, Wxh) + nd.dot(r * h, Whh) + bh)
        h = z * h + (1 - z) * g
        
        yhat_linear = nd.dot(h, Why) + by
        yhat = softmax(yhat_linear, temperature=temperature) 
        outputs.append(yhat)
    return (outputs, h)
```

## Cross-entropy loss function

```{.python .input  n=12}
def cross_entropy(yhat, y):
    return - nd.mean(nd.sum(y * nd.log(yhat), axis=0, exclude=True))
```

## Averaging the loss over the sequence

```{.python .input  n=13}
def average_ce_loss(outputs, labels):
    assert(len(outputs) == len(labels))
    total_loss = nd.array([0.], ctx=ctx)
    for (output, label) in zip(outputs,labels):
        total_loss = total_loss + cross_entropy(output, label)
    return total_loss / len(outputs)
```

## Optimizer

```{.python .input  n=14}
def SGD(params, lr):    
    for param in params:
        param[:] = param - lr * param.grad
```

## Generating text by sampling

    #     1) feed in the current input
    #     2) sample next character from from output distribution
    #     3) add sampled character to the decoded string
    #     4) prepare the sampled character as a one_hot (to be the next input)
